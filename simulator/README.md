# Simulator

The simulator will model the world, organisms, and rendering pipeline. It brings together the genome package, physics, resource dynamics, and visualization to run full life-sim experiments.

Planned components:
- World state, physics, and tick loop
- Organism lifecycle management (spawn, update, death)
- Interaction with genome outputs to build organisms
- Rendering hooks for debugging and visualization
- Configuration and experiment orchestration tools
