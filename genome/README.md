# Genome

This package will house the core genome logic, including byte-encoded genome definitions, gene interfaces, mutation utilities, and serialization helpers. It is intended to stay lightweight and reusable so experiments can import the genome layer independently from the simulator.

Planned components:
- Genome byte format and parsing utilities
- Gene definition interfaces and registration
- Mutation operators and validation helpers
- Unit tests for genome parsing and mutations
